Here is a sample task manager program in Python that allows the user to create, view, update, and delete tasks:

This program uses a list to store tasks and functions to add, view, update and delete tasks. It also uses a while loop to allow the user to choose an action to perform. Inputs are taken using the input() function, and tasks are displayed using the for loop and the print() function.

Note that this program is a simple example to show you how to create a task management program in Python. There are other improvements you could make, such as saving tasks to a file for users to use later.
